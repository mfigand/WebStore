This is an example of a e-commerce were you can display your products, view different info clicking the tabs,
hide the product if it's sold out or write and submit reviews for each product.

To run properly you need serve the app.

If you have node, using http-server is enough.

The technologies i used in this app are:

* AngularJS v1.5.3

* JavaScript node v5.10.1

* jQuery JavaScript Library v2.1.4

* Bootstrap v3.3.6
